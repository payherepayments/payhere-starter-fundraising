# Payhere fundraising starter

A funraising starter, built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Paynere](https://payhere.co). It allows you to easily create a nice, mobile-optimised website and be collecting one-off and recurring donations.

### Prefer fully managed?

If you don’t have the technical know-how, or would prefer that we do the heavy lifting for you, [contact us](mailto:hello@payhere.co) and we’ll set everything up, tweak the colours and images to match your brand, and give you a content management system to update your content whenever you want. *We’ll charge you for the domain name (if you don’t already have one) and a small monthly fee for the setup and hosting.*

## Getting started

If you want to use this template and are familiar with Gatsby you can start a new project using the following command:

```sh
$ gatsby new fundraising-starter https://github.com/payherepayments/payhere-starter-fundraising
$ cd fundraising-starter
$ yarn develop
```

That’s it, you can now edit the content in `./siteConfig.js` and you’ll be off to the races.
