# Payhere fundraising starter

This is a funraising page starter, built using Gatsby and Paynere. It allows you to easily push up a nice mobile optimised website to collect donations using Payhere.

[Live demo](https://my-fundraising-page.netlify.com/)

### Example

### Fully managed

If you don’t have the technical know-how, or would prefer that we do the heavy lifting you can [contact us](mailto:hello@payhere.co) and we’ll set everything up for you, tweak the colours and images to match your brand and give you a content management system login to tweak your content whenever you want. *We’ll charge you for the domain name if you don’t have one and a small monthly fee for setup and hosting.*

## Getting started

If you want to use this template and are familiar with Gatsby you can start a new project using the following command:

```sh
$ gatsby new fundraising-starter https://github.com/payherepayments/payhere-starter-fundraising
$ cd fundraising-starter
$ yarn develop
```

That’s it, you can now edit the content in `./siteConfig.js` and you’ll be off to the races.
